# Hotel Retainer :hotel:
> The given dataset is a supervised classification dataset. It holds booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel with information such as How and when the booking was made, the length of passengersâ€™ stay with the number of parking slots available, the number of adults, children, and babies. The Logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forest algorithms are used to handle this supervised classification model. Among these four machine learning algorithms, Random forest and Decision trees perform well with respect to accuracy.

To map the predicted values to probabilities sigmoid function is used. It maps the values between the range of 0 and 1. The threshold value is used in the logistic regression to compute the S Shape. The threshold value defines the probability of either 0 or 1. The value above the threshold tends to be 1, and the values below the threshold tend to 0.

>Assumptions for Logistic Regression
The data must follow a normal distribution.
The dependent variable must be categorical.
The independent variable should not have multi-collinearity
Type of Logistic Regression
The Logistic regression is classified into three types based on the categories.

Binomial: If dependent variables hold two categories such as 0 or 1, male or female, pass or fail, it comes into binomial logistic regression.
Multinomial: If a dependent variable holds three or more possible unordered categorical variables, such as cat, dog, lion, it comes into multinomial logistic regression.
Ordinal: If the dependent variable holds three or more possible ordered categorical variables such as low, medium, high, it comes into ordinal logistic regression.
